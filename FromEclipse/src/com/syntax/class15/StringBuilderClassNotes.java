		 *   String
		 *    are immutable, that means
		 *   once we store a string in a variable we can not change its value, if we are changing the value, a new object in String--
		 *   constant pool is created and reference is reassigned to that variable.
		 *   StringBuilder
		 *   is mutable, which means we can change the value of a variable and no new memory cell is created
		 *   When to use Strings:
		 *   
		 *   When we have a lot of repetition in the data and we care about the memory consumption--here use String.
		 *   When to use StringBuilder:
		 *   When there are a lot of changes to the data and we care more about the speed of the program, we should use StringBuilder class
		 *   
		 *   Difference between StringBuilder and StringBuffer is that StringBuilder is not thread safe, hence more fast 
		 *   And StringBuffer is thread safe , but slow.
