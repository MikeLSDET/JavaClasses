Constructors:
    is a special block of code that helps us build/initialize(give initial values to fields) our objects.
    when we write new className(); the code inside the no argument constructor is executed.
    when we do not provide a constructor a default no argument  constructor is provided by compiler.
    if we have multiple constructors' java will check number of arguments and type of arguments to decide which
    constructor to execute.
    if we have same number of parameters and their data types are also same
    we will get an error as now Java cannot decide which constructor to call.

    This()
    "this" keyword when used with parenthesis calls the constructor of a class which constructor to call
    is decided based on the data type of arguments that we are passing.
    It helps us  reduce duplicate code as in real life projects we might be writing a lot of constructors.
