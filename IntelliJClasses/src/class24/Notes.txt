Method overloading in java:
Method overloading is when we have the same name of a method inside  a class but with different type, number of or,
 sequence of parameters.
 We overload methods to reuse code and write cleaner code.

 class overload{

 void hello(
{}

void hello(String name){
//overloading by changing number of parameters
}
void hello(String [])names{
//overloading with different type of parameters
}

void hello(String [] names, String name)
{//overloading by changing number of parameters

}
}

Method overloading rules:
1. to overload, we must have at least 2 methods with same name inside a class
2.we cannot overload a method by just changing the return type
3.we cannot overload by just changing the access modifier
4.static methods can also be overloaded
5.We can also overload the constructors of a class as well.


Var args (...)
is a mechanism in java through which we can handle arrays and multiple arguments of same type in
a method parameter.
We can treat the var args same as an array inside the method

void(String ... names){
sout names[0];
sout names.length
for (int i =0; i<names.length;i++){
sout names[i];
}
}
interview question:
Can we overload main method?

Yes, you can overload main method in Java.
But the program doesn't execute the overloaded main method when you run your program,
you have to call the overloaded main method from the actual main method.
