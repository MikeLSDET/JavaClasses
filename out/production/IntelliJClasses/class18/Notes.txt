Constructors:

In java, a constructor is a block of codes similar to the method.

It is called when an instance of the class/object is created, and memory is allocated for the object.
It is a special type of method which is used to initialize the object.

NOTE: if there is no constructor in a class, compiler automatically creates a default constructor.

=====================================

Class Constructors and "this" keyword
Constructor is very similar to a method, methods mat or may not return something.
but a constructor always never return anything not even void.
1) we use constructors to give initial values to fields of class.
2) constructors always have the same name as class name, while methods can have any name.
how to write a constructor example below
Person{
String name;
String address;
int age;
String country;

Person(){
sout"Inside the person class constructor  ,this code will be executed automatically
when we create the object of the class"

}
Contructors help build/to initialize object.

}

we can have multiple constructor to ease the creation of object
when we have multiple constructors java decides based on type and number of arguments that
we are passing when we are creating an object, if we are passing three values, java will search for a
constructor that takes 3 parameters and initialize your object with that constructor.
