Access modifiers:
Keywords that determine the access of the members(fields/methods/constructors)
There are four access levels, but only 3 access modifier keywords.

**fields are variables with declare inside the class
**methods are behaviors(actions)
1.Private (most restricted), default( not keyword) 3. protected, 3. public
1.private:
    if we use the private keyword with the fields or methods, those fields and
    methods are only accessible within the same class.
2.default:
   default is not a keyword if we don't specify any keyword with the fields/methods
   then default access is automatically applied by java... that means that field or method
   is accessible within the same class and within the same package.
3.protected:
    if we use the protected keyword that field/method is accessible within same
    class and within same package... if we want to give access outside of same package with have to write extends
    keyword and we can only access it without creating an object of that class.

4. public:
    public means accessible throughout project with or without creating an object of that class
