"this" keyword:
We can use this keyword to differenetiate between local and instance variables.
example:
class car{
String make;
String model;
int year;
Car(String make, String model, int year){
String make="Honda";
this.make=make;
this.model=model;
this.year=year;
}

void(){
int year=2021;
String make="Honda";
String model="Civic";
System.out.println(this.make+this.model+this.year);
}


}
"this()"
we can use this with parenthesis to refer to the constructors of the class
if we have multiple constructors' java will decide based on the parameters
which constructor to call.
"this" keyword can also be used to call the methods
======================================
Inheritance:
is mechanism in java through which we can access all the fields and methods from one class
inside another class.
We use "extends" keyword to inherit the properties and methods
benefits:
we can avoid code duplication
it improves the performance
it reduces the amount of memory required to run the program.
Parent child classes are tightly coupled, meaning that if we make any changes we must change the
child classes as well, otherwise code may break.
1.Single inheritance
one single parent class and one single child class.
2.Multilevel inheritance
we have a chain of classes inheriting from each other for example:
class c =>class b=>class a
3.Hierarchical inheritance:
one parent class and multiple child classes
